#Disabler Beta v1.2.9 Instructions

#NO-ADMIN TLAUNCHER (FREE MINECRAFT JAVA), NO-ADMIN ROBLOX, AND NO-ADMIN NATIVE ADOBE FLASH PLAYER WITH A TON OF OLD COOLMATH GAMES WHICH DONT WORK ON THE ACTUAL WEBSITE ANYMORE COMING SOON!!!!

#Start by downloading the file as a ZIP

#After that, find it in your downloads folder (or click on the arrow next to the file at the bottom of your chrome window and click "Show in folder").

#Right click on the  zipped folder and click extract all.

#Click extract in the pop-up menu.

#Now double-click on the newly created normal folder and open it.

#BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AFTER THIS POINT, MAKE SURE GOOGLE CHROME IS CLOSED!!!!

#After closing Google Chrome, right click on the taskbar at the very bottom of your screen and click "task manager".

#Now scroll down until you see lots of Google Chromes.

#Right click on each on of them and click "end task", until all of them close(Just spam it).

#Now restart the computer.


#Log Back in and open Google.

#When you log into Google, click on the GoGuardian Extension Icon at the top right, underneath the "X" button.

#It will say, "file has been moved or deleted".

#Now, click 2-Minecraft in the Disabler folder, or any other game we add in the future.

#In the Folder, another folder will pop up which will either be called, "Runtime" or "Game". Don't click on them or delete them, just let them be.

#When you launcher the game, the other folder will appear(again, either "Runtime" or "Game"). Just let them be.

#When you finish playing, click 3-pause. This will disguise all of your data and worlds to look like ordinary stuff.

#Unless you want to delete your worlds and data completely, dont click 4-End, unless you're switching desks or something.

#Make sure to delete the disabler file after pausing or ending it, then redownload it once you get back to the computer. (Althought, GoGuardian will be permanently deleted from the computer, so you don't have to do those steps again).

#Congratulations, you have successfully disabled GoGuardian :)))))

#Changelog Beta v1.2.9:

#New Tlauncher added but you can't use it yet without admin, I still have to add the Java.exe file for it to work. Also, I haven't added the Ghost Code (Which is what I'm calling the Appdata disguise code). Beta v1.3 will take a while, but it will have a ton of bugfixes and new games.
