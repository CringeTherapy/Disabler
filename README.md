#Disabler Beta v1.3.1 Instructions

Pls discord me if there are any problems with this (Will add my discord link when i release to public)

#Start by downloading the file as a ZIP

#After that, find it in your downloads folder (or click on the arrow next to the file at the bottom of your chrome window and click "Show in folder").

#Right click on the  zipped folder and click extract all.

#Click extract in the pop-up menu.

#Now double-click on the newly created normal folder and open it.

#BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AFTER THIS POINT, MAKE SURE GOOGLE CHROME IS CLOSED!!!!

#After closing Google Chrome, right click on the taskbar at the very bottom of your screen and click "task manager".

#Now scroll down until you see lots of Google Chromes.

#Right click on each on of them and click "end task", until all of them close(Just spam it).

#Now restart the computer.

#Log Back in and open Google.

#When you log into Google, click on the GoGuardian Extension Icon at the top right, underneath the "X" button.

#It will say, "file has been moved or deleted".

TO DOWNLOAD NORMAL MINECRAFT:----------------------------------------------------------------------

#Now, click 2-Minecraft in the Disabler folder, or any other game we add in the future.

#In the Folder, another folder will pop up which will either be called, "Runtime" or "Game". Don't click on them or delete them, just let them be.

#Also, it might ask you to update the launcher, DONT DO IT. IT WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER AND REQUIRE ADMIN!!!

#When you launcher the game, the other folder will appear(again, either "Runtime" or "Game"). Just let them be.

#When you finish playing, click 3-pause. This will disguise all of your data and worlds to look like ordinary stuff.

#Unless you want to delete your worlds and data completely, dont click 4-End, unless you're switching desks or something.

#Make sure to delete the disabler file after pausing or ending it, then redownload it once you get back to the computer. (Althought, GoGuardian will be permanently deleted from the computer, so you don't have to do those steps again).

TO DOWNLOAD FREE MINECRAFT(TLAUNCHER):-------------------------------------------------------------

#So, first start by opening normal minecraft. then login with a random microsoft or mojang account that you havent bought minecraft on

#Then launch the demo version.

#Dont enter a singleplayer world, just launch it, then close the window.

#After that click 2-Tlauncher. Then set a name for urself and click launch download. (to do this u have to have a phone and have ur hotspot connected to the computer, bug fix for that coming in Alpha 1.2).

#Ok thats it for now

#Congratulations, you have successfully disabled GoGuardian :)))))
