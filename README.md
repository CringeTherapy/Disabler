#Disabler v1.0 Instructions FOR GOGUARDIAN and a Gamer kit for all school computers and none require admin.

#For those of you who want to use windows on chromebook, just go to this website lol(the free trial doesnt need credit card):

#https://www.apponfly.com/windows-vps

#[READ ALL OF THIS EVEN IF U JUST WANT TO DELETE GOGUARDIAN OR JUST WANT TO PLAY A GAME]

#Pls discord me if there are any problems with this (https://discord.gg/suGzyAnA)

#Start by downloading the file as a ZIP

#After that, find it in your downloads folder (or click on the arrow next to the file at the bottom of your chrome window and click "Show in folder").

#Right click on the  zipped folder and click extract all.

#Click extract in the pop-up menu.

#Now double-click on the newly created normal folder and open it.

#BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AFTER THIS POINT, MAKE SURE GOOGLE CHROME IS CLOSED!!!!

#Now click 1-Start and click the underlined text, then run anyways. u can see the code to make sure it not virus. If the message doesnt come for u thats fine.

#Restart the computer.

#Log Back in and open Google.

#When you log into Google, click on the GoGuardian Extension Icon at the top right, underneath the "X" button.

#It will say, "file has been moved or deleted".

TO DOWNLOAD NORMAL MINECRAFT:----------------------------------------------------------------------

#Now, click 2-Minecraft in the Disabler folder, or any other game we add in the future.

#In the Folder, another folder will pop up which will either be called, "Runtime" or "Game". Don't click on them or delete them, just let them be.

#Also, it might ask you to update the launcher, DONT DO IT. IT WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER AND REQUIRE ADMIN!!!

#When you launch the game, the other folder will appear(again, either "Runtime" or "Game"). Just let them be.

#When you finish playing, click ghost. This will disguise all of your data and worlds to look like ordinary stuff.

#Unless you want to delete your worlds and data completely, dont click 4-Fullghost, unless you're switching desks or something.

#Make sure to delete the disabler file after ghosting or fullghosting it, then redownload it once you get back to the computer. (Althought, GoGuardian will be permanently deleted from the computer, so you don't have to do those steps again).

#when u get back, just click unghost and it will restore all ur data if you ghosted it

TO DOWNLOAD FREE MINECRAFT(TLAUNCHER):-------------------------------------------------------------

#So first, start by opening this google drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Fj2_fcETkiH5rjTEKg8cIaIOVgfBATG?usp=sharing

#Click Download all in the top right corner of the webpage.

#When u download it, extract the zipped folder it made.

#In the newly-created normal folder called runtime-(a ton of random letters and numbers here), there will be another folder called just runtime.

#Copy the folder that is just called runtime, and paste it with all the other files like 1-start, 2-minecraft, etc.

#After that click 2-Tlauncher. Then set a name for urself and click launch download. (to do this u have to have a phone and have ur hotspot connected to the computer, bug fix for that coming in Beta 1.3.9.5).

#Ok thats it for now

#Congratulations, you have successfully disabled GoGuardian :)))))
